                    <p class="major__project__content__text">
                        This coding project was started and completed in the summer of 2020, when the COVID-19 lockdown in the US was at its peak. When I was researching different methods to grow an Instagram account, I noticed that most of the methods used a paid service. As a result, I thought to myself that such products would not be too difficult to program; not easy, but still doable.
                    </p>
                    <p class="major__project__content__text">
                        That was the birth of my first major, original project. The Instagram bot is 100% my original code. I posted this project in hopes that the competition for growing Instagram accounts becomes a more even playing field.

                        This pi estimation visualizer uses the Monte Carlo Method to estimate the value of pi. The program randomly generates points in a square with a circle inscribed into the square. Then pi is caluclated by multiplying 4 to the ratio between the number of points generated in the circle and the number of total points.

                        My favorite game when I was around twelve years old was this small, award winning game called piano tiles. Then, as I was getting more and more experienced with web scrapping and autoclicking using python, I revisited this childhood memory by creating a bot to automatically play for you.

                        I was inspired to create this project when me and my friends were competing to see who could type the fastest. As a result, I learned the web scrapping module Selenium to beat all my cheaply beat all my friends. There are two different websites that you can choose upon to speed type on when launching the script.

                    <p class="minor__project__content__text">
                        Depending on your CPU speed, you can reach different speeds. My personal record using this bot is 8,000 words per minute.

                        This password generator is one of the classic beginner projects that everyone creates when first learning how to program.

                        Since this program has a GUI instead of being console based, it is easier to use than many other beginner password generators out there. Each time a modification is made, the password generated automatically updates.
