                My name is Jonathan Lin. I'm a 16 year old high school student from Houston, TX. I'm nationally ranked in tennis (top 200) and taught myself the programming languages of Python, Java, HTML, and CSS (although the debate of CSS and HTML as "real coding" languages is still ongoing). I hope to pursue a career involving computer science and make a positive impact on the world.

                Just like how general engineering (cars, air conditioning, modern buildings, etc) has greatly impacted and is integrated into our daily lives, computer related technology (artificial intelligence, innovative software, self-driving cars, etc) will do the same. Determined, ambitious, and loving tennis, I hope to make a positive dent in the world with computer science: not technology dominating our lives, but rather working harmoniously with humans to make our lives easier and more enjoyable.
